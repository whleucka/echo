; Static pool: workers are always running, no spawn/kill overhead per request.
; Tune pm.max_children based on available memory:
;   memory per worker ≈ 40-60MB, so 128 workers ≈ 5-7.5GB
pm = static
pm.max_children = 128

; Max requests before worker respawn (prevents memory leaks over time)
pm.max_requests = 1000

; Slow request log (helps find bottlenecks)
slowlog = /proc/self/fd/2
