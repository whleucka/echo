{#
  Echo Debug Toolbar - Twig Template

  Note: The primary toolbar is rendered by DebugToolbar::render() and injected
  automatically into HTML responses. This template is provided as an alternative
  if you prefer to manually include the toolbar in specific templates.

  The toolbar now supports HTMX request tracking:
  - Each HTMX request sends debug data via X-Echo-Debug-* headers
  - JavaScript listens for htmx:afterRequest events
  - Request history shows all requests made during the page session
  - Click any request to see its queries, timing, and memory usage

  Usage (if needed manually):
    {{ include('debug/toolbar.html.twig', { debug: profiler().getSummary() }) }}
#}

{# The toolbar is automatically injected by Response::send() when APP_DEBUG=true #}
{# This file is kept for reference and potential customization #}
